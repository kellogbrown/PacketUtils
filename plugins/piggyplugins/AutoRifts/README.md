**How to setup**:

- Starting Fragments
  - How many fragments to mine before leaving the starting area
- Minimum Fragments
  - Amount in inventory to start mining more fragments
- Ignore Portal Ess
  - Ignores the portal if you have at least this many essence in inventory
- Drop Runes
  - Check to drop all runes instead of depositing
- Drop Runes Filter
  - Comma delimited, rune names to drop - the rest will be deposited
- Use Essence Pouches?
  - Requires NPC Contact runes or redwood lit lantern
- Abyssal Book in bank? (IMPORTANT FOR NPC CONTACT)
  - Check if you have the abyssal book in the bank
  - This is required because owning the abyssal book changes the dialogue option

- Prioritize Higher Tier Runes (BETA)
  - Prioritizes Nature/Law/Death/Blood runes even if points aren't balanced - Expect some bugs
