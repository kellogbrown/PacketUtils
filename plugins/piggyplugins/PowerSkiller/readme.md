**How to setup**:

- Should Bank?
    - Will attempt to find the nearest bank and deposit all but needed items
- Toggle
    - Your start/stop hotkey
- Search NPCs
  - Check if fishing, or if the object you're interacting with is represented as an NPC in game
- Object
  - The name of the object you want to interact with
- Expected action
  - The menu action you expect to be able to perform on the Object
- Tool(s)
  - Comma delimited list of tools necessary to successfully interact with the object
- Keep Items
  - Comma delimited list of items to avoid dropping while skilling
- Tick Delays
  - Set min/max delays to speed up or slow down the plugin
- Drop Config
  - Set min/max items to drop per tick
- Forestry Tree
  - This will focus on the object with most players by it
  - Uncheck this if you are NOT woodcutting
  - This is not guaranteed to target the tree with most people chopping it, but its what works
